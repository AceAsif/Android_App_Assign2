# Android_App_Assign2
This is my Android App assignment for KIT305 assignment-2.
I got 81.25 % which is a HD for this assignment.
I have not make the app compatible for all phone screens (yet!) as it was not a requirement for the assignment.

Some notes for testing my app:
1) The app was designed in Pixel 4XL API 31 emulator.
2) The orientation is vertical.
3) You need to long press an item to delete an item in History page.
4) You need to press "Enter" button to save your name.
5) If you can't see the picture in History page that means that I took the picture and it could only be viewed on my emulator or phone. If the user didn't take picture, then you will show a default image.
6) SimpleDateFormat("ss.SSS") shows the milliseconds with seconds. This allows the user to see how many milliseconds it took him to press each button. I didn't include hour and minute because the user can see from the start and end time so it would be redundant information.
